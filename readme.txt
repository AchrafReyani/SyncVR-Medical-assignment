button called Reset is used to reset the fibonacci number.
with update you perform once calculation causing the fibonacci number to increase.

the background music changes as the fibonacci number increases.
background music was made with https://splice.com/sounds/beatmaker
The idea was inspired by videogames where a song gets more instruments as you progress through the game.
for example:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODyypARcFhk

the clicking sounds were made by tapping my fingers on the desk. It was to give an old school clicking vibe
and i added several sounds so you won't hear the exact same sound everytime depending on the rng.

The sprites were made with https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite

After going past 10 million you will be "rewarded" it should rather be called punished, with a sprite animation
that should have never been made.

The idea behind the sprite animation was just to see if I could make it appear and dissapear.
there was no specific purpose for it design wise.

the background was made to add a bit of life to the game as a blank color without anything moving is a bit dull.
